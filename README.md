# Madou Monogatari 2 (PC-98) (February 2024) #

## Intro ##
"I just want your power, is all."

Arle Nadja, now grown up, is accosted by a dark wizard. Knocked unconcious,
she's dragged into his underground prison. Use your skills and limited
resources to escape from his clutches!

Madou Monogatari has been released and remade on several other systems,
but the PC-98 edition holds a weird place where they abandoned the trademark
cuteness of Puyo Puyo and other Madou Monogatari releases in favor of a
dark, realistic depiction of the monsters in the mazes. They went back
to the cute style after these ones, but the experimental nature of these
is still worth experiencing!

The patch has been tested on a PC-9821 AP2.
If your system can run the Japanese version of the game, then this version
should work as well. If you run into any issues, please let us know!

For emulating, we recommend Neko Project with save state support enabled.
You can save anywhere in the base game, but you have to insert a data floppy
to save, then reinsert the game floppy every time. Save stating instead
makes things a bit easier. We do recommend saving manually now and then
just in case! If we release an updated patch, you'll need to make a manual
save before switching over.

## FAQ ##
- Is this the one with--
  Yes.

## Tips ##
- The game does NOT use numbers for health and damage! Instead, values are
  described via words, such as "I'm still doing great!" or
  "Oh god my vision's fading..."
- There's an orb of water near the start that will heal you as much as you need.
- Always buy the Skillful Algae, Swift Algae, and Eyeball Grass from the merchants!
  They have a limited supply and permanently increase your stats.
- Some enemies are weak to Fire, whereas others are weaker to Ice Storm.
  For instance, Puyos will freeze when hit by Ice Storm, then break when hit by
  Ice Storm again. Try different combinations and see what sticks!
- In this one, you start with all the spells you need. Being level 1, however,
  means you may not have the mana required for a while.
